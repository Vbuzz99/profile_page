<p><h1>About...</h1></p>
<p>I'm Viraj Basnayake and I see myself as a person who is passionate about his own work.<br/> 
Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.<br/> 
In my school life, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. <br/>
For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and graphics. <br/>
I soon became the go-to person  of my friends for any design needs.”

<br/><br/><br/>

You will also see that I’m a people person. <br/>
I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. <br/>
I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence.<br/>
I find this skill is especially helpful when kicking off projects with people.<br/>
